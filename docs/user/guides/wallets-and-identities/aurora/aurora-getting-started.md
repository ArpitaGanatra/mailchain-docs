# Introduction

Aurora is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based on the layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain NEAR Protocol. Aurora provides a solution for developers to deploy their apps on an Ethereum-compatible platform, with low transaction costs for their users.

You can register .aurora NFT names at [Freename.io](http://Freename.io), then ‘_mint’ them on the Aurora blockchain. These domains give people full ownership and control of their digital identity, with no renewal fees._
