# Introduction

Lens Protocol is a Web3 social graph on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake blockchain. It offers a user-owned, open social graph (including profiles) that any application can plug into. Since users own their data, they can bring it to any application built on top of Lens Protocol. As the true owners of their content, creators no longer need to worry about losing their content, audience, and livelihood based on the whims of an individual platform's algorithms and policies -- _source [https://docs.lens.xyz/](https://docs.lens.xyz/)_.
