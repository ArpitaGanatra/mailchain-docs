Mailchain users can use their Avalanche C-Chain wallet addresses and .avax names to send and receive messages. It’s simple to get started…

# Introduction

_**Avalanche®** is an open-source platform for launching decentralized finance applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Everything on Avalanche is a Subnet, and every chain is part of a Subnet. Validators are required to be a member of the Primary Network; all other Subnets are optional. The Primary Network contains three blockchains: Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), Exchange Chain (X-Chain)._ Source: [https://support.avax.network/](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4135427-avalanche-platform-overview)

_**.avax domain names** are provided by [Avvy Domains](https://avvy.domains/), a naming service designed to support the Avalanche ecosystem and its various subnets._ — Source: [Avvy Domains](https://avvy.domains/)
