Mailchain users can use their Freename Web3 domain names to send and receive messages. It’s simple to get started…

# Introduction

Freename ([https://freename.io](https://freename.io)) is a web3 domain registrar for top-level domains (TLD) and second-level domains (SLD). Users can register and mint their own web3 TLDs and SLDs. These domains give people full ownership and control of their digital identity, with no renewal fees.
