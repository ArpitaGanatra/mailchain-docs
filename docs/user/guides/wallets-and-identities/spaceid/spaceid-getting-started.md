Mailchain users can use their SPACE ID domains e.g. `.bnb` & `.arb` to send and receive messages. It’s simple to get started…

# Introduction

[SPACE ID](https://space.id/) is building a universal name service network with a one-stop identity platform to discover, register, trade, manage web3 domains. It also provides a multi-chain name service for everyone to easily build and create a web3 identity. —_Source: [SPACE ID Documentation](https://docs.space.id/)_

## How To Add Your SPACE ID Domain To Mailchain

### Prerequisites:
