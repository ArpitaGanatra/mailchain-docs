# Introduction

Your Mailchain account is your new identity.

You can use it for messaging other Mailchain users or any blockchain addresses. Your identity is yours. Nobody, not even Mailchain has access to it. When you create a Mailchain account, two things happen:

1. The Mailchain username that you choose is registered to your identity (which is linked to your [Seed Phrase](#your-seed-phrase)).
1. You create a [safe space](#your-safe-space) to keep your messages, registered addresses, labels, and other application data.

## Your Seed Phrase:

Your Seed Phrase is a collection of words that can be used to access your identity. There is no way to recover this if you lose it. Store a copy it somewhere safe (for example a password manager or written down and locked away).

## Your Safe Space

All your data is encrypted with a key derived from your password. This password never leaves your browser. It should be a very strong password or passphrase. You should store a copy it somewhere safe (for example a password manager or written down and locked away).

## Important considerations

### What happens if I forget my seed phrase for my identity?

If you forget your seed phrase, you will no longer have access to your mailchain identity.

You may still be able to recover your account if you have your Mailchain username and password. If not, you will need to register as a new user and re-register any addresses and re-create any labels.

### What happens if I forget my password?

If you forget your password, you will no longer have access to your labels, registered addresses folders, historic messages, and other application data.

To recover your account, you will need to log into Mailchain using your seed phrase, then re-register any addresses and re-create any labels.
