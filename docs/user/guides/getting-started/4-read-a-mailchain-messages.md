# How To Read Mailchain Messages

1. If you have not already [created a Mailchain account](./2-create-a-mailchain-account.md), please do so now. Otherwise, ensure you are logged in to your inbox.
1. In the sidebar on the left, look at 'Inbox' if you solely use your Mailchain username, or 'All Inboxes' if you have registered other blockchain addresses. There will be a number showing the number of unread messages.
1. Click on 'Inbox', 'All Inboxes' to see all your messages. Any unread ones will have a blue dot next to them.

You can mark messages as read or unread, or carry out other actions including _star_ to mark as important or _archive_ to remove them from view.
