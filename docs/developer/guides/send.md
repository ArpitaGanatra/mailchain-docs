# Sending Messages

Using Mailchain you can send a message to any blockchain address. Only the owner of the address will be able to receive and read the message.

## Send your first message

```ts
import { Mailchain } from '@mailchain/sdk';

const mnemonicPhrase = 'cat mail okay ...'; // securely include mnemonic phrase

const mailchain = Mailchain.fromMnemonicPhrase(mnemonicPhrase); // use your mnemonic phrase

const result = await mailchain.sendMail({
	from: `yoursername@mailchain.local`, // sender address
	to: [`0xbb56FbD7A2caC3e4C17936027102344127b7a112@ethereum.mailchain.com`], // list of recipients (blockchain or mailchain addresses)
	subject: 'My first message', // subject line
	content: {
		text: 'Hello Mailchain ðŸ‘‹', // plain text body
		html: '<p>Hello Mailchain ðŸ‘‹</p>', // html body
	},
});

console.log(result);
```

:::note

You can send a message to your `username@mailchain`, or if you've registered an ethereum address you can send a message to it (e.g. `0x.....@ethereum.mailchain.com`). You can also try sending a message to `0xbb56FbD7A2caC3e4C17936027102344127b7a112@ethereum.mailchain.com`, that's a valid, unmonitored address at Mailchain, we own the private key for it.

:::

After the message is successfully sent you will be able to see it in your [sent folder](https://app.mailchain.com/sent) and the recipient will see it in their inbox.

:::note

The Mailchain app checks for messages and updates the inbox in the background. You can force a refresh by clicking on the refresh icon above the list of messages.
